everything seems to be an icon these days.
What happened to words and things. How come they somehow blended together into this meaningless, sketchy drawing that doesn't get you neither one or the other. They trick your brain into clicking or sweeping or ignoring

Shortcuts to nothing, that's what they are. Stupid fucking icons.
