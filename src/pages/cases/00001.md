# Murder, he prompted

Chief Prompter Jameson 'Stiegowitz' Aguardento carefully dragged and even more carefully dropped the pdf file into the designated interface and clicked the *SEND* button.

The detective on the other side of the screen started thinking and analyzing and reasoning on the file while a rotating circle kept rotating on the screen. *Agentic policing* they now call it. Can you believe this shit?, thought Aguardento, where *you* was still himself, or the imaginary listener that he usually impersonated during his workdays, the patient ??? of all his complaints.

When he finished digesting the file the detective asked:

```
How can I help you today, Chief?
```

For Christ's sake, can't you just figure it out, since you're so smart, thought Aguardento.

Sospir√≤, scosse la testa, asking himself if he could believe this shit. 

```
murder
```
, he prompted.

A rotating icon appeared on the screen and Aguardento was once again staring at that.
